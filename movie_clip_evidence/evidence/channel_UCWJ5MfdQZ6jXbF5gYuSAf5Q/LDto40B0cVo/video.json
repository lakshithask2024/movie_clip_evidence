    "description": "Take a look at the 'Who's The Opening Act' Clip for I Can Only Imagine 2, a faith family drama film distributed by Lionsgate. As record sales fall, things have to shake up with a brand-new opening act. I Can Only Imagine 2 is in theaters on February 20, 2026.\n\nBart Millard is living the dream—sold-out arenas, a devoted fan base, and a thriving career. But behind the spotlight, Bart’s past threatens the family he’s built, especially the fragile bond with his son, Sam. When hopeful newcomer Tim Timmons joins the band for their biggest tour yet, he unknowingly brings a renewed gratitude to Bart’s life through their unlikely friendship. Bart soon discovers that Tim carries hardships—and secrets—of his own, forcing him to face his past and repair his relationships with Sam and his wife, Shannon, before fame costs him what matters most.\n\nI Can Only Imagine 2 stars John Michael Finley, Milo Ventimiglia, Sophie Skelton, Arielle Kebbel, Sammy Dell, with Trace Adkins, and Dennis Quaid. The film is written by Brent McCorkle, alongside being produced by Kevin Downes, Andrew Erwin, Cindy Bond, Bart Millard, Daryl Lefever, and Joshua Walsh.\n\nI Can Only Imagine 2 is in theaters on February 20, 2026.",
