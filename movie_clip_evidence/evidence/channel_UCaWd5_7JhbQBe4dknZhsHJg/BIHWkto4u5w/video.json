    "description": "History has a dark side where power often shields the guilty from justice. Join us as we explore infamous figures who committed horrific atrocities yet escaped punishment! Our countdown includes tyrants, dictators, and royals whose crimes shocked humanity, yet who lived out their lives without facing true justice for their deeds. From Leopold II's Congo nightmare to Stalin's purges, Hirohito's wartime role to Elizabeth Báthory's alleged bloodbaths - these powerful individuals escaped the accountability their victims deserved. Mengele fled to South America, Pol Pot died before true justice arrived, while Henry VIII's tyranny was simply accepted as royal prerogative. Which unpunished historical villain shocked you most?
