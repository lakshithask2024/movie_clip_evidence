    "description": "Why Disney Is Afraid of a Ben Solo Movie\n\nWhen rumors of The Hunt for Ben Solo surfaced, they reignited one of Star Wars’ most volatile debates. Could Ben Solo return after The Rise of Skywalker — and should he? According to reports, the answer from Disney was ultimately no, despite genuine creative interest from Lucasfilm.\n\nThis video explores why a Ben Solo solo film became strategically radioactive. Unlike most Star Wars projects, The Hunt for Ben Solo wouldn’t exist in a neutral space. Any attempt to continue Ben’s story would immediately reopen arguments about sequel trilogy canon, Kylo Ren’s redemption, and whether sacrifice in Star Wars still matters.\n\nWe break down the core dilemma Disney faced: bringing Ben Solo back risks undermining his death, while keeping the story symbolic risks disappointing audiences who want something concrete. Either choice creates backlash before marketing even begins.\n\nBy looking at Disney’s post-Solo: A Star Wars Story strategy, Kathleen Kennedy’s recent comments, and the shrinking theatrical slate, it becomes clear why Lucasfilm is prioritizing control over bold provocation. The Hunt for Ben Solo wasn’t rejected for being bad — it was rejected for being too consequential.\n\nThe result tells us a lot about the kind of Star Wars movies Disney is willing to make next.\n\n0:00 The Kiss That Changed Everything\n1:12 The Ben Solo Movie Pitch\n2:52 Why Canon Makes This Impossible\n4:05 Disney’s Caution Era\n5:49 Solo’s Lasting Impact\n6:41 The Sequel Trilogy Problem\n7:28 Why Success Would Be Awkward\n8:40 Will Disney Ever Take This Risk?\n\nSubscribe | Enable ALL push notifications 🔔\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@ScreenRant?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow Screen Rant:\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@screenrant \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/screenrant \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant  \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/ \n\nOfficial Screen Rant Website: \nhttp://screenrant.com/\n\nVideo by: Jon Alba & Jose Morfin \n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com\n\n#starwars #kyloren #bensolo #lucasfilm #adamdriver #screenrant",
