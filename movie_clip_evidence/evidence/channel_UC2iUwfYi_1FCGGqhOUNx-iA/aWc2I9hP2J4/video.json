After years of mismanagement under Ronald Perelman, Marvel was forced to sell off its most valuable characters just to survive — leaving the company with little more than merchandise revenue and shrinking influence.\n\nThe turning point came when David Maisel proposed a radical solution: stop licensing characters and start betting on Marvel itself. With backing from Merrill Lynch, Marvel put its remaining heroes — including the Avengers, Captain America, and Doctor Strange — up as collateral in a deal that could have ended the company for good.\n\nWe break down Avi Arad’s exit, Kevin Feige’s early rise, Jon Favreau’s creative philosophy, and why Robert Downey Jr. was considered an enormous liability before Iron Man proved everyone wrong.
