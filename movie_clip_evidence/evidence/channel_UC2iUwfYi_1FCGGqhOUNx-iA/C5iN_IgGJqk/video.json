    "description": "Tom Cruise has built an entire career on doing what no other movie star would dare attempt — but some of those stunts came terrifyingly close to ending everything.\n\nFrom a sword fight gone wrong on The Last Samurai to a parachute malfunction during Top Gun, Cruise’s obsession with authenticity has repeatedly put his life on the line. This video breaks down the most dangerous moments from Cruise’s career, including his shattered ankle in Mission: Impossible – Fallout, the cliff jump in Dead Reckoning, and the biplane stunt that reportedly caused him to lose consciousness mid-flight.\n\nWe’ll explore how these stunts went wrong, what saved him at the last possible second, and why Cruise continues pushing himself further as Hollywood’s last true action star. Along the way, we revisit classic films like Days of Thunder and the original Mission: Impossible, showing how this reputation was forged decades ago.\n\nThese aren’t just behind-the-scenes anecdotes — they’re reminders of how thin the line between spectacle and disaster really is, and why Tom Cruise’s stunt legacy remains unmatched.\n\n0:00 Tom Cruise’s Stunt Obsession\n0:31 The Last Samurai Sword Near-Miss\n1:58 Top Gun Parachute Malfunction\n3:12 Mission: Impossible – Fallout Broken Ankle\n4:42 Final Reckoning Biplane Stunt\n5:56 Dead Reckoning Cliff Jump\n7:08 Original Mission: Impossible Explosion\n8:00 Early Career Close Calls\n\nSubscribe | Enable ALL push notifications 🔔\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@ScreenRant?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow Screen Rant:\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@screenrant \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/screenrant \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant  \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/ \n\nOfficial Screen Rant Website: \nhttp://screenrant.com/\n\nVideo by: Michael Keene & Kem Ramirez \n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com\n\n#tomcruise #missionimpossible #moviefacts #behindthescenes #screenrant",
