As outside interests move in, rising tensions lead to conflict between local groups and authorities. Based on real events, the story explores how greed, power, and desperation can spark consequences that reach far beyond one community and ripple through the global energy industry.\n\nDirector: Curtis Graham\nCast: William R.
