    "description": "A man washes ashore with no clear memory of how he arrived there.\nThe past keeps pulling him back, whether it’s real or not.\n\nAfter a powerful storm, Ali wakes up alone on a deserted beach, confused and unwell. With nowhere else to turn, he is helped by locals who offer him temporary shelter in Havana. As Ali tries to recover, unsettling dreams and vivid visions begin to blur the line between memory and imagination, forcing him to question what truly happened to him — and whether he can ever leave the past behind.\n\nDirector: Vicente Peñarrocha\nCast: Mohamed Chafik, Ako Chavarri.\n© Published under license.\n#Guantanamero #FullMovie #Thriller #Mystery #Drama\n····················································································\nSUPPORT US!\n ✅ SUBSCRIBE to the channel: https://tinyurl.com/SUB-FINMovies\n\nWATCH MORE MOVIES! \n► Trending Now: https://tinyurl.com/TrendingMovies-FINMovies\n► Documentaries: https://tinyurl.com/TrendingDocs-FINMovies\n\nSocial Media\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/filmisnowtrailers\nX: https://twitter.com/filmisnow\n····················································································\n** All of the content on this channel is under legal license from various copyright holders and distributors.
