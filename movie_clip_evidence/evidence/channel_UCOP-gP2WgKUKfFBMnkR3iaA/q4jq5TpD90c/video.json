    "description": "A massive object is on a direct course for Earth.\nSaving the planet means risking everything beyond the atmosphere.\n\nWhen scientists discover a colossal meteor heading straight for Earth, they realize time is dangerously short. Early attempts to alter its path fail, forcing an international team to take a desperate risk: landing directly on the object itself. As unexpected challenges arise in space, the mission becomes a race not just against time, but against the limits of human survival.\n\nDirector: Noah Luke\nCast: Patrick Labyorteaux, Caroline Williams, Joseph Michael Harris, Anthony Jensen.\n© Published under license.\n#DoomsdayMeteor #FullMovie #SciFi #Disaster #Survival\n····················································································\nSUPPORT US!\n ✅ SUBSCRIBE to the channel: https://tinyurl.com/SUB-FINMovies\n\nWATCH MORE MOVIES! \n► Trending Now: https://tinyurl.com/TrendingMovies-FINMovies\n► Documentaries: https://tinyurl.com/TrendingDocs-FINMovies\n\nSocial Media\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/filmisnowmovies/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/filmisnow_movies\nX: https://twitter.com/filmisnow\n····················································································\n** All of the content on this channel is under legal license from various copyright holders and distributors.
