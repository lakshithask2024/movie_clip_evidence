When he discovers his son has been falsely accused of a serious crime, Animal is pressured to use the skills that once defined him in order to help from the inside. Outside the walls, his other son works with a lawyer to uncover the truth, setting both paths on a collision course toward justice.\n\nDirector: Ryan Combs\nCast: Ving Rhames, Vicellous Shannon.\n© Published under license.\n#Animal2 #FullMovie #CrimeThriller #Action #Drama\n····················································································\nSUPPORT US!\n ✅ SUBSCRIBE to the channel: https://tinyurl.com/SUB-FINMovies\n\nWATCH MORE MOVIES! \n► Trending Now: https://tinyurl.com/TrendingMovies-FINMovies\n► Documentaries: https://tinyurl.com/TrendingDocs-FINMovies\n\nSocial Media\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/filmisnowtrailers\nX: https://twitter.com/filmisnow\n····················································································\n** All of the content on this channel is under legal license from various copyright holders and distributors.
