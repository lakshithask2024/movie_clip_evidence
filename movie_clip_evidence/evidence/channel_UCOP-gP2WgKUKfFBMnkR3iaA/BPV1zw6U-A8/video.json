    "description": "A quiet desert town is shaken by a growing sense of fear.\nStopping what’s coming next becomes a race against time.\n\nA remote California desert town is unsettled by a series of unexplained crimes carried out by a lone individual moving without a clear motive. With pressure mounting, Captain Peters and his understaffed police force launch an urgent manhunt across empty roads and isolated streets. As the search tightens, the challenge becomes finding the suspect before the town is pushed beyond its breaking point.\n\nDirector: Rocky Costanzo\nCast: Quinton “Rampage” Jackson, Steve De Forest, Noel Gugliemi.\n© Published under license.\n#APsychosPath #FullMovie #CrimeThriller #Mystery #Suspense\n····················································································\nSUPPORT US!\n ✅ SUBSCRIBE to the channel: https://tinyurl.com/SUB-FINMovies\n\nWATCH MORE MOVIES! \n► Trending Now: https://tinyurl.com/TrendingMovies-FINMovies\n► Documentaries: https://tinyurl.com/TrendingDocs-FINMovies\n\nSocial Media\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/filmisnowtrailers\nX: https://twitter.com/filmisnow\n\n#fullmovies #freemovies #mustwatchmovies\n····················································································\n** All of the content on this channel is under legal license from various copyright holders and distributors.
